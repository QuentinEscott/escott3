I thought it would be apt for my first SCCM post to talk about the first Microsoft KB that me and my team had created.
It was [KB4465865](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4465865/software-updates-do-not-download-in-configmgr-if-wsus-is-disconnected).
We were upto date with our SCCM install (Current Branch 1806) so we were able to get the Microsft engineering team to make a hot fix for us. It took many hours on the phone.
